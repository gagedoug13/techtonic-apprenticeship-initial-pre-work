### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**
- I didn't struggle with this section but I think there are a couple of good takeaways that can be taken 
from here. One thing to remember is that HTML5 has a few cool built in properties that allow you to control whether your inputs get submitted or not. Like the required property. On my last project I would check to see if the input contained any contents before allowing it to be submitted. Required is a simple shortcut to do the same thing. Also the checked property can be useful with radio buttons and check boxes.


### Introduction to Basic CSS
**Say Hello to Basic CSS**
-  This section was a little more challenging but never too daunting. Something that I learned about CSS through this course that i thought was interesing is the !important CSS property that can be used to guarantee that an element would belong to a specified class when it loads into the page. That was my biggest takeaway from this section. It wasn't too bad to work through.


### Introduction to CSS FlexBox Challenges
**Say Hello to CSS FlexBox Challenges**
- Ahhh FlexBox. I honestly love FlexBox. The challenges in this course were pretty straight forward and kind of give you the answer at some points. I recommend FlexBox Froggie. That game was the first place I started learning FlexBox and it's pretty useful. My biggest takeaway from this course was that FlexBox is really nice and I love working with it. I'm curious about what the grid challenges will be like.
