### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**
- I didn't struggle with this section but I think there are a couple of good takeaways that can be taken 
from here. One thing to remember is that HTML5 has a few cool built in properties that allow you to control whether your inputs get submitted or not. Like the required property. On my last project I would check to see if the input contained any contents before allowing it to be submitted. Required is a simple shortcut to do the same thing. Also the checked property can be useful with radio buttons and check boxes.


### Introduction to Basic CSS
**Say Hello to Basic CSS**
-  This section was a little more challenging but never too daunting. Something that I learned about CSS through this course that i thought was interesing is the !important CSS property that can be used to guarantee that an element would belong to a specified class when it loads into the page. That was my biggest takeaway from this section. It wasn't too bad to work through.


### Introduction to CSS FlexBox Challenges
**Say Hello to CSS FlexBox Challenges**
- Ahhh FlexBox. I honestly love FlexBox. The challenges in this course were pretty straight forward and kind of give you the answer at some points. I recommend FlexBox Froggie. That game was the first place I started learning FlexBox and it's pretty useful. My biggest takeaway from this course was that FlexBox is really nice and I love working with it. I'm curious about what the grid challenges will be like.



### Introduction to CSS Grid Challenges
**Say Hello to CSS Grid Challenges**
- I feel like the grid challenges were a little more challenging than the FlexBox challenges. I enjoy both and I can understand when it would be necessary to use one over the other. I typically think FlexBox makes more sense but I don't mind grid. Interesting lesson.

### Introduction to JavaScript Challenges
**Say Hello to JavaScript Challenges**
- This lesson was a good refresher on the different built in methods used in JavaScript and the type of thinking that is required to solve certain challenges. I didn't get stuck on any lessons but I did find a few of them to be pretty challenging. This course covers quite a bit of material briefly without getting too in debth so I would've like to see them dig deeper into for loops and other parts of the course. There were a few different lessons that I had taken something good from while working on this section. I hadn't heard of the 'delete' property in JavaScript so I thought that was cool to be able to delete a key and value from an object. I can see how it'd be helpful to be able to delete some piece of data from a database using the 'delete' method.

### Introduction to ES6
**Say Hello to ES6**
- This was definitely the most challenging section in the program but also the most rewarding. ES6 offers a ton of different ways to clean up your code and provide clarity when working on a project. Implementing destructuring is an awesome way to refactor your code as well. I also learned a couple things about destructuring that I didn't know before, like how you can name variables in a nested object. I thought that was super interesting.
